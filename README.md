# HTML Links - Lab

## Introduction
You've seen HTML tags and tag attributes. In this lab, you'll bring those together by investigating the anchor tag, `a`. 

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Use an anchor tag to create a link

## Use an `a` Tag to Create a Link

Open `index.html` in your text editor. Add an `a` tag with the inner text (the
text between the `<a>` tag and the `</a>` tag) of
`Flatiron School` anywhere in the file. Then set the `href` attribute of your
new link element to `https://flatironschool.com`.

## Viewing Your Work in the Browser

Once you add the `a` tag to your web document, preview it in your web browser!
As a reminder, here's how to do that via learn:

## Summary

Here you saw how an attribute helps the `a` tag do its job, which is to link to another location.
